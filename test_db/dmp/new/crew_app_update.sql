UPDATE public.crew_app_update SET title = 'Changelog 0.0.8', slug = 'changelog-008', content = 'Honestly just putting some stuff in there so that it looks a little fuller for the test screen. Stuff changed since my last commit was adding the Updates model, templates, and views. That is what is showing here. There have been further changes to make it so that we can generate dynamic and interesting content from the front page and show we are moving on.

Next up is focusing on permissions and getting those implemented. Once we have permissions implemented finishing setting up the Crew Manager will be essential. We are getting closer and closer with those steps. If I can get some good development time in tonight and tomorrow I should be able to get this launched.

We also need to setup the Docker stuff so I can run this in Docker containers getting it ready to move up to the cloud. Part of that will involve also getting all the other pieces setup like it is a real deployment. 

There is the question of using SQLite or Postgres. I am using Postgres at the moment but there are some arguments for SQLite. I don''t think it really matters that much though. Will probably keep what is in place.', created_on = '2022-07-30 15:59:04.581664 +00:00', author_id = 1 WHERE id = 8;
